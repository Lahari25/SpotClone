# SpotClone
A music recommendation system similar to Spotify



## Description

The goal of this project is to create a recommendation system that allows users to discover music based on a given playlist or song they already enjoy. This project starts with data collection and builds a self-growing dataset to ensure the model remains effective over time, progressing through to model deployment.
I was not able to upload all the files due to size constraint in github, so I will give my google drive link where all the files are present.
